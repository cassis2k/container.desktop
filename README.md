## Personal Project

This is a personal project aimed at learning and understanding the software development chain while addressing a real need. The code is generated by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), with careful attention to respecting development standards as much as possible.

## Overview

Container.desktop provides a graphical interface for Apple's `container` CLI, allowing you to manage images, containers, volumes, and networks without using the command line.

## Features

- **Images Management**: List and delete container images
- **Containers**: Coming soon
- **Volumes**: Coming soon

- [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container) **v0.7.1** or later installed and running
